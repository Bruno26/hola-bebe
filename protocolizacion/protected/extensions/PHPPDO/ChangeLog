Fixed syntax error in postgres (maybe others too)
where a string literal can not be separated by space
from a quoted string. For example
    regexp_split_to_table('some string', E'\\s+')
would break, because the query parser would generate: E '\\s+'

Fixed a bug, which would result in a syntax error
when casting values in postgres. For example:
	SELECT '1'::integer;
would break, because the parser was thinking that
":integer" is an oracle placeholder.

Fixed a bug in the mysql driver (using the mysql extension)
when a null value is supplied to the quote method, it would return
an empty string.
